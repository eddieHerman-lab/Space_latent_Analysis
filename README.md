### Abstract

The growing sophistication of generative AI models presents significant challenges for content auditing and authenticity detection, largely due to the "black-box" nature of their latent spaces. To address this gap, this paper proposes a new framework for the structural analysis of the latent space, which operates not as a classifier, but as a "microscope" to investigate the structural properties of the representations. Our methodology was validated on a controlled synthetic dataset and then applied to a real-world case study on the CelebA dataset, revealing the framework's dual potential as a tool for both auditing bias and discovering creative outliers.

### Key Heuristics
The framework is built on a funnel of quantitative heuristics:
* **Uniqueness:** Measures the topological distinction of a sample based on its statistical independence and spatial isolation.
* **Originality:** Quantifies informational complexity using spectral and spatial entropy.
* **Creative Latent Score (CLS):** A combined metric to navigate the creative frontier of the latent space.
* **Bias Metrics (SBS & ABI):** Scores to identify and characterize stereotypical clusters.

### Project Structure

This repository is divided into two main parts:

1.  **Synthetic Environment (`/src`):** The Python scripts (`.py`) used for the experiments on the synthetic dataset, as described in Section 4 of the paper. This includes model training, hyperparameter optimization, and heuristic validation.
2.  **CelebA Case Study (`.ipynb`):** A complete Jupyter Notebook (`notebook_analise_celeba.ipynb`) containing the full analysis pipeline applied to the CelebA dataset, as described in Section 6 of the paper.

## Quick start

## Quick start (minimal)

1. Clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eddieHerman-lab/Analise_Space_latent.git
cd Analise_Space_latent

# 2) Install (recommended: venv)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Download data (Kaggle required):

Put your kaggle.json in ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json (chmod 600), then:

bash
Copy
Edit
bash scripts/download_data.sh
# Edit scripts/download_data.sh to set DATASET_ID first

What to expect in this repo
notebooks/ — full Colab notebook with the full pipeline and figures.

scripts/ — small helpers: download, create demo subset.

outputs/ — curated PNGs used in the preprint (kept small).

requirements.txt — pinned deps for reproducibility.

LICENSE, CITATION.cff, .gitignore

Reproducibility tips
Do not commit kaggle.json or any model checkpoints.

If you want identical figures, use the PNGs in outputs/ or fix the normalization bounds and seeds in the notebook plotting cells (set_xlim, set_ylim, fixed min/max values).

Outputs: The main paper figures are stored in outputs/images/ — run the notebook only if you want to reproduce the pipeline"


Set seeds in the notebook for NumPy/PyTorch/UMAP for more stable visuals.
